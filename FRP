FRP (Fast Reverse Proxy) – Short Notes

Definition:

FRP is an open-source reverse proxy tool that exposes internal/private servers to the public internet.

Works on a client-server architecture:

:-FRP Server (frps) → Public server with a public IP.

;-FRP Client (frpc) → Private/internal server behind NAT/firewall.

Use Cases:

* Access private servers (SSH, HTTP, databases) remotely.

* expose internal services behind NAT/firewall without modifying security rules.

* Remote development or testing.


<h2>Installation on AWS EC2 (Ubuntu 22.04)</h2>
# Step 1: Launch EC2 Instances

FRP Server: Public subnet, public IP.

FRP Client: Private subnet, no public IP.

Open security group ports:

7000 → FRP server

7500 → Dashboard

Remote ports → Services to expose (e.g., 6000 for SSH)

# Step 2: Download FRP

wget https://github.com/fatedier/frp/releases/latest/download/frp_<version>_linux_amd64.tar.gz
tar -xzf frp_<version>_linux_amd64.tar.gz
cd frp_<version>_linux_amd64

# Step 3: Configure FRP Server (frps.ini)
[common]
bind_port = 7000
dashboard_port = 7500
dashboard_user = admin
dashboard_pwd = strongpassword

<h3>Start server:</h3>
./frps -c frps.ini

 # Step 4: Configure FRP Client (frpc.ini)
[common]
server_addr = <FRP_SERVER_PUBLIC_IP>
server_port = 7000

[ssh]
type = tcp
local_ip = 127.0.0.1
local_port = 22
remote_port = 6000

# Start client:
./frpc -c frpc.ini

# Now you can SSH to the private EC2 via the FRP server:

ssh -p 6000 ubuntu@<FRP_SERVER_PUBLIC_IP>
